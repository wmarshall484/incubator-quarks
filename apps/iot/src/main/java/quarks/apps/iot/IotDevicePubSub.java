 * Application sharing an {@code IotDevice} through publish-subscribe. <BR>

 * across multiple independent applications, without having to build a single
 * topology.
 * <P>
 * Applications coded to {@link IotDevice} obtain a topology specific
 * {@code IotDevice} using {@link #addIotDevice(TopologyElement)}. This returned
 * device will route events and commands to/from the actual message hub
 * {@code IotDevice} through publish-subscribe.
 * <P>
 * An instance of this application is created by first creating a new topology and
 * then creating a {@link IotDevice} specific to the desired message hub. Then
 * the application is created by calling {@link #createApplication(IotDevice)}
 * passing the {@code IotDevice}. <BR>
 * Then additional independent applications (topologies) can be created and they
 * create a proxy {@code IotDevice} for their topology using
 * {@link #addIotDevice(TopologyElement)}. This proxy {@code IotDevice} is then
 * used to send device events and receive device commands in that topology. <BR>
 * Once all the topologies have been declared they can be submitted.
