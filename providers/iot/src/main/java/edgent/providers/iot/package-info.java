/**
 * Iot provider that allows multiple applications to
 * share an {@code IotDevice}.
 * 
 * <H3>IoT device</H3>
 * 
 * <H3>Application registration</H3>
 * The provider includes an {@link edgent.topology.services.ApplicationService ApplicationService} that allows applications
 * to be registered by name. Once registered an application can be started (and stopped) remotely
 * through the control service using a device command.
 * 
 * <H3>Supported device commands</H3>
 * This provider supports a number of system level device commands to control the applications
 * running within it.
 * <H4>Control service</H4>
 * Device commands with the command identifier '{@link edgent.connectors.iot.Commands#CONTROL_SERVICE edgentControl}'
 * are sent to the provider's control service, an instance of {@link edgent.runtime.jsoncontrol.JsonControlService JsonControlService}.
 * This allows invocation of an operation against a control mbean registered with the
 * control service, either by an application or the provider itself.
 * <BR>
 * The command's data (JSON) uniquely identifies a control MBean through its type and
 * alias, and indicates the operation to call on the MBean and the arguments to
 * pass the control MBean.
 * <BR>
 * Thus any control operation can be remotely invoked through a {@code edgentControl} device command,
 * including arbitrary control mbeans registered by applications.
